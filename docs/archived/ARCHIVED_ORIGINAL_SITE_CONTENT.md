### Path 2: Studio Investment

**Overview**:
- **Tagline**: "Equity in Rationale + Portfolio Exposure"
- **Status**: OPEN — FLEXIBLE ENTRY POINTS
- **Highlight**: "Partners Help Decide Which Bets We Make"
- **Description**: "Invest in Rationale (the holding company) for equity exposure across the entire portfolio: Zero, Atlas, Amplify, and future ventures. Studio partners participate in decision-making on which bets to pursue and bring strategic value through domain expertise, distribution, or operational support."

**Three Ways to Participate**:

1. **Strategic Partner (Preferred)**
   - Capital + domain expertise + distribution
   - Help shape roadmap, introduce customers, advise on GTM
   - Ideal: Operators with sector expertise (CRE, sports tech, B2B SaaS), strategic acquirers, platform companies
   - Involvement: Active
   - Equity: Negotiable based on strategic value beyond capital

2. **Capital Partner**
   - Pure capital investment for diversified portfolio exposure
   - Ideal: Investors seeking systematic venture building exposure, family offices, angels
   - Involvement: Passive (quarterly updates, portfolio visibility)
   - Equity: Standard terms based on capital committed

3. **Future Fund (Late 2025/2026)**
   - Wait for formal fundraise after proof of repeatability
   - Ideal: VCs and institutional investors who want proof of systematic model before investing
   - Involvement: Passive (fund structure with portfolio-wide exposure)
   - Equity: Fund economics (carry structure, management fee)

**Governance Process**:

**Quarterly Venture Review** (Q1: Jan, Q2: Apr, Q3: Jul, Q4: Oct)
- Matt presents 3-5 venture concepts with detailed briefs
- Market, TAM, differentiation, budget, timeline

**Partner Input Period** (2-week feedback window)
- Strategic partners provide feedback, ask questions, vote
- Input weighted by equity stake and strategic value

**Final Decision & Allocation** (Announced end of each quarter)
- Matt makes final call incorporating partner feedback
- Capital allocated from studio reserves ($500K+ annual budget)

**Build & Launch** (2-6 month builds)
- Ventures built using studio resources
- Strategic partners can opt in for deeper involvement

**Strategic Partner Rights**:
- Quarterly vote on venture roadmap (weighted by equity + strategic value)
- Access to detailed venture briefs before launch decisions
- Optional advisory board seat (for $250K+ strategic partners)
- Right of first refusal on leading rounds in portfolio companies
- Quarterly financials & metrics dashboard access

**Example Scenario**:
"Matt presents 4 concepts: (1) B2B Compliance SaaS, (2) Consumer Health App, (3) Real Estate PropTech, (4) AI Code Review Tool. Strategic partner in CRE sector votes to prioritize #3, provides customer intros. Matt incorporates feedback, builds #3 as Q1 venture with partner's pilot commitment."

**Current Portfolio Companies**:

1. **Zero Inbox**
   - Stage: Live + Revenue
   - Status: App Store, 37K users, $4K MRR growing 40%/mo
   - Market: AI email triage & productivity
   - Ownership: Rationale owns majority equity

2. **Atlas CRM**
   - Stage: Blueprint Complete
   - Status: 103KB docs, $165K budget, Q1 2025 target
   - Market: B2B CRE intelligence platform
   - Ownership: Will be owned by Rationale upon build

3. **Amplify Athletes**
   - Stage: Blueprint Complete
   - Status: 129KB docs, $60-250K tiered, Q2 2025 pilot
   - Market: NIL marketplace & athlete tools
   - Ownership: Will be owned by Rationale upon build

**Portfolio Expansion Roadmap**:
- 2024-2025: Zero (live), Atlas, Amplify (3 ventures)
- 2026: +2 new ventures (5 total)
- 2027: +2 new ventures (7 total)
- 2028: +2 new ventures (9 total)
- 2029: +1 new venture (10 total)

**Sectors**: SaaS, AI/ML, B2B Tools, Consumer Apps, Vertical Software—partners help choose focus areas

**Studio Economics**:
- Rationale is the holding company that owns equity in all portfolio ventures
- Kits generate $900K+ annually at 90% margin (funds operations + ventures)
- Studio invests $200-300K per venture (capital efficient)
- Retain majority equity in each venture (50-80% typical)
- Portfolio compounds: 10 ventures × $5-50M exits = $50-500M portfolio value

**CTA**: Discuss Studio Partnership (/investment/studio)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why should I invest in Zero vs. the studio (Rationale)?**
A: Zero offers concentrated exposure to a live, revenue-generating product with clear near-term liquidity potential (24-36 months). Studio investment (Rationale equity) offers diversified exposure across the entire portfolio: Zero, Atlas, Amplify, and future ventures—plus you help decide which bets we make together.

**Q: What is Rationale and how does it relate to the ventures?**
A: Rationale is the holding company (the studio) that owns equity in all portfolio ventures: Zero, Atlas, Amplify, and future companies. When you invest in the studio, you're buying Rationale equity, which gives you exposure to the entire portfolio. When you invest in Zero directly, you own Zero equity specifically.

**Q: Can I invest in Atlas or Amplify directly, not through the studio?**
A: Atlas and Amplify are built and owned by Rationale (the studio). You invest in the studio to get exposure to them. If you bring exceptional strategic value (CRE relationships for Atlas, NIL expertise for Amplify), we may negotiate direct equity or preferential studio terms based on your strategic contribution beyond capital.

**Q: What makes this different from other venture studios?**
A: Three things: (1) We're self-funded through client services ($900K run rate), removing dilution pressure. (2) AI acceleration enables 2-3 ventures per year instead of 1 every 2 years. (3) Solo founder model means no partner conflicts and total execution control. (4) Studio partners actively help decide which bets to pursue—not passive LPs.

**Q: How do you build so capital-efficiently?**
A: AI tooling + 7 years at Meta + solo founder model. Zero cost $35K to build (8 microservices, 182 Swift files, live on App Store). Atlas roadmap took 3 weeks (103KB docs). Amplify blueprint took 2 weeks (129KB docs). We leverage AI for architecture, code generation, and planning, then add Meta-grade execution discipline for production quality.

**Q: What's the exit strategy?**
A: For Zero: Target $50K MRR ($600K ARR) in 18 months, then either (1) strategic acquisition by email/productivity companies or (2) continue growing to profitability. For portfolio ventures: Mix of strategic acquisitions, revenue-based exits, and long-term holds. Studio model isn't built for quick flips—we build businesses that compound and appreciate.

**Q: Are both Zero and Studio raising simultaneously?**
A: Yes. Priority is to secure BOTH: (1) $600K for Zero to fund 18-month runway to $50K MRR, and (2) studio partners to secure operating budget, hire engineers, and fund Atlas/Amplify builds. We're flexible on studio terms based on strategic value partners bring.
