# Content Migration Assessment: rationale-site → RationaleStudio

**Date:** 2025-12-02
**Reviewer:** Rationale Marketing Reviewer (Senior Marketing Executive & Brand Strategist)
**Scope:** Audit rationale-site content, prioritize what to port to public RationaleStudio site

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The rationale-site contains **substantial high-quality content** that is currently MISSING from the public RationaleStudio site. However, it suffers from three critical issues:

1. **Over-leveraging Meta credentials** — Borrowed authority without clear connection to current execution proof
2. **Over-complexity** — 4 mental models + 4 frameworks + extensive founder story = cognitive overload
3. **Unclear commercial pathway** — Philosophy-heavy, proof-light for buyers

**KEY RECOMMENDATION:** Port 30-40% of the content, ruthlessly cut the rest. Lead with Zero proof, streamline philosophy to 2-3 core beliefs, make engagement tiers immediately legible.

---

## CONTENT INVENTORY & PRIORITIZATION

### 1. `/how-we-work` PAGE — **HIGH PRIORITY**

**What it contains:**
- Three engagement models (Cash, Equity, Hybrid) with clear structures
- Process timeline (Week 1-6+: Align → Prototype → Test → Refine/Build)
- "Why equity alignment matters" section
- Equity ranges: 0.5-3%, 6-18 months typical
- Zero referenced as proof of equity commitment

**Commercial Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (9/10)

**Assessment:**
- **STRENGTHS:**
  - Crystal clear engagement tiers with pricing structure visible (even without exact numbers)
  - Equity model is explicit and compelling
  - Zero used as authentic proof ("Like Zero—we take equity when we believe")
  - Process is buyer-comprehensible (not jargon-heavy)

- **WEAKNESSES:**
  - Still missing actual pricing numbers (which may be intentional)
  - Could be even more concise (currently ~295 lines)

**PORT RECOMMENDATION:** ✅ **YES — HIGH PRIORITY**

**What to bring:**
- All three engagement model cards with structure breakdowns
- Process timeline (4-phase framework)
- "Why equity alignment matters" section
- Zero proof callout

**What to cut:**
- None — this is already lean and commercial

**Structural improvements:**
- Add this as `/how-we-work` or integrate key elements into homepage
- Consider creating `/pricing` or `/engagement-tiers` for clearer navigation
- Add clear CTA: "Book a Kit Scoping Call" (already present)

---

### 2. `/about` PAGE CONTENT — **MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY (WITH CUTS)**

**What it contains:**
- Dual-engine model (Rationale Kits fund runway, Portfolio IP accumulates value)
- Origin story: "The Whiteboard Moment"
- 4 Mental Models with analogies and applications:
  1. Clarity Precedes Illumination
  2. Course Before Speed
  3. Environment Shapes Behavior
  4. Intelligence Felt, Not Flaunted
- 4 Frameworks in Practice:
  1. Hardest Risk First
  2. Behavior-First Design
  3. Progressive Conviction
  4. Circuit Before Lightbulb
- Portfolio IP proof section
- Extensive founder profile (7 years Meta, patent, personal story)

**Commercial Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (7/10 — high quality but too dense)

**Assessment:**

**STRENGTHS:**
- Dual-engine model is well-articulated
- Mental models are differentiated and practical
- Frameworks have clear "When to Use" and "How It Works" sections
- Founder background is credible without being credential-waving
- Portfolio IP section shows metrics (3 ventures, 1 month execution, 350KB+ docs)

**WEAKNESSES:**
- **MASSIVE COGNITIVE OVERLOAD:** 4 mental models + 4 frameworks = 8 distinct concepts to absorb
- Philosophy-heavy, proof-light (especially compared to RationaleStudio's current Zero-forward approach)
- Origin story feels theoretical ("AI inverted the bottleneck") rather than lived experience
- Founder section is comprehensive but risks burying the lede (what can you do for ME)

**PORT RECOMMENDATION:** ✅ **YES — BUT RUTHLESSLY CUT**

**What to bring (30% of content):**
- ✅ Dual-engine model explanation (Kits fund runway, Portfolio appreciates)
- ✅ 2 mental models maximum: "Clarity Precedes Illumination" + "Course Before Speed" (these are the most commercially relevant)
- ✅ 1-2 frameworks: "Hardest Risk First" + optionally "Behavior-First Design"
- ✅ Portfolio IP metrics (3 ventures, 1 month, 350KB docs, Zero live on App Store)
- ✅ Founder background (condensed to 3 paragraphs: Meta 7 years, patent, why Rationale exists)

**What to cut (70% of content):**
- ❌ "The Whiteboard Moment" origin story (too abstract, not differentiated)
- ❌ "Environment Shapes Behavior" mental model (nice to have, not core differentiator)
- ❌ "Intelligence Felt, Not Flaunted" mental model (generic AI UX principle, not Rationale-specific)
- ❌ "Progressive Conviction" framework (covered by existing process timeline)
- ❌ "Circuit Before Lightbulb" framework (redundant with "Clarity Precedes Illumination")
- ❌ Extended founder personal story (pottery, beef wellington, Peloton) — move to LinkedIn or personal site

**Structural improvements:**
- Move frameworks to `/how-we-work` or dedicated `/frameworks` page
- Keep About page lean: Who We Are → Dual-Engine Model → Portfolio Proof → Founder (brief) → CTA
- Consider creating `/philosophy` for deeper mental models (optional, not required for commercial goals)

---

### 3. `/work` PAGE — **LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**What it contains:**
- Case study teasers (password-protected: Fubo, Rumi, Zero)
- Past experience section (Meta AR work 2018-2024)
- Entry point before individual work pages

**Commercial Value:** ⭐⭐⭐ (6/10)

**Assessment:**

**STRENGTHS:**
- Password-protected case studies signal selectivity and confidentiality
- Past experience shows 7 years of Meta AR leadership
- Provides context for "why we can execute at this level"

**WEAKNESSES:**
- **OVER-LEVERAGES META CREDENTIALS:** Past experience dominates, Portfolio IP is secondary
- RationaleStudio's current approach is better: lead with Zero/Compass (proof YOU built), then mention Meta context
- Password-protected case studies create friction — may reduce conversion for cold traffic

**PORT RECOMMENDATION:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL — RESTRUCTURE**

**What to bring:**
- ✅ Past experience section (condensed to 2-3 key Meta projects)
- ⚠️ Password-protected case studies (consider: do these serve commercial goals or create unnecessary friction?)

**What to skip:**
- ❌ Long-form case study teasers (too much context before paywall)
- ❌ Separate `/work` landing page (RationaleStudio's homepage already serves this function)

**Structural improvements:**
- **Current RationaleStudio structure is BETTER:** Homepage features Zero prominently, then Compass, then "Building in Public" callout
- Move Meta experience to `/about` page as "Operator Background" section (not its own page)
- Consider making case studies fully public OR remove them entirely (password protection reduces utility)

---

### 4. ZERO CONTENT COMPARISON — **CRITICAL**

**rationale-site `/zero` page:**
- Clean, minimal design (no ASCII grids, no glass cards)
- Interactive demo with StarfieldBackground
- Features grid
- Beta signup focus
- Marketing-forward (less technical depth)

**RationaleStudio `/work/zero` page:**
- Full execution proof showcase
- 10 microservices, 182 Swift files, A+ architecture
- 7 interactive prototypes
- Beta rollout strategy with 4-cohort plan
- Investment opportunity callout ($600K seed round)
- "What Zero Proves About Rationale" section

**ASSESSMENT:**

**RationaleStudio version is SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER for Rationale's commercial goals.**

**Why:**
- Dual-purpose: proves execution capability AND markets the product
- Technical depth signals seriousness to B2B buyers and investors
- Clear connection: "This is how we work — same speed for your product"
- Investment opportunity is explicit (not hidden)

**PORT RECOMMENDATION:** ❌ **DO NOT PORT from rationale-site**

**What to do:**
- ✅ Keep RationaleStudio's `/work/zero` page as primary
- ✅ Consider creating `/zero` as consumer-facing redirect or lightweight marketing page
- ❌ Do NOT replace RationaleStudio's execution proof with rationale-site's marketing-only version

---

## CRITICAL RISKS: OVER-LEVERAGING & GIMMICKS

### 🚨 RISK 1: Meta Credential Over-Leverage

**Evidence from rationale-site:**
- `/work` page leads with "Past Experience" (Meta AR 2018-2024)
- `/about` page has 6 paragraphs of founder personal story
- 4 separate Meta projects detailed (AR Commerce, Spark AR, Orion, RUMI)

**Why this is a risk:**
- Borrowed authority ≠ proof YOU can execute NOW
- Buyers care about "what can you do for me" not "where did you work"
- RationaleStudio's current approach is better: Zero proof first, Meta context second

**CORRECTION:**
- ✅ Keep RationaleStudio's homepage structure: Zero hero → Portfolio → Services → Meta context as "Why We Ship Fast" section
- ✅ Mention Meta in passing ("7 years at Meta Reality Labs taught us..."), not as primary credential
- ✅ Lead with Portfolio IP (Zero, Compass) — this is authentic proof

---

### 🚨 RISK 2: Over-Complexity & Philosophy Overload

**Evidence from rationale-site:**
- 4 mental models + 4 frameworks = 8 concepts
- Each with setup, analogy, application, when to use, how it works, outcomes
- Total content: ~420 lines in `philosophy.ts` alone

**Why this is a risk:**
- Buyers want clarity, not mental model education
- 8 frameworks = cognitive overload = "this feels complicated"
- Philosophy-heavy positioning can signal theory over execution

**CORRECTION:**
- ✅ Cut to 2-3 core beliefs maximum ("Clarity Before Code" + "Course Before Speed" + "Build to Prove")
- ✅ Make frameworks optional/secondary content (not primary homepage messaging)
- ✅ Lead with proof (Zero), not philosophy

---

### 🚨 RISK 3: Unclear Commercial Pathway

**Evidence from rationale-site:**
- Homepage (not reviewed, but inferred from other pages) likely leads with philosophy
- `/about` page is 632 lines of philosophy, founder story, frameworks
- `/how-we-work` exists but may not be prominently linked

**Why this is a risk:**
- Buyers need to self-qualify: "Is this for me? What's the price range? How do I start?"
- Philosophy pages don't convert — clear service tiers do
- RationaleStudio's current homepage is better: clear services section with Clarity/Prototype/Build Ship Run kits

**CORRECTION:**
- ✅ Keep RationaleStudio's services structure visible on homepage
- ✅ Add `/how-we-work` page from rationale-site (already structured well)
- ✅ Make engagement tiers discoverable within 2 clicks from homepage

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS: WHAT TO PORT

### ✅ HIGH PRIORITY (Port immediately)

1. **`/how-we-work` page content** — All of it
   - Three engagement models (Cash, Equity, Hybrid)
   - Process timeline
   - "Why equity alignment matters"

2. **Dual-engine model explanation** (from `/about`)
   - Rationale Kits fund runway
   - Portfolio IP accumulates value
   - How they work together

3. **2 core mental models** (from `/about`)
   - "Clarity Precedes Illumination"
   - "Course Before Speed"

4. **1-2 practical frameworks** (from `/about`)
   - "Hardest Risk First"
   - Optionally: "Behavior-First Design"

### ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Port with edits)

5. **Portfolio IP proof section** (from `/about`)
   - 3 ventures, 1 month execution, 350KB+ docs
   - Zero metrics (live on App Store, 7 prototypes, etc.)

6. **Condensed founder bio** (from `/about`)
   - 7 years Meta Reality Labs
   - 1 patent
   - Why Rationale exists (2-3 paragraphs max)

7. **Past experience section** (from `/work`)
   - 2-3 key Meta projects (not all 4)
   - Move to `/about` page, not separate `/work` page

### ❌ LOW PRIORITY / SKIP

8. **"The Whiteboard Moment"** origin story — Too abstract
9. **Extended founder personal story** — Not commercially relevant
10. **2 additional mental models** — Cognitive overload
11. **2 additional frameworks** — Redundant
12. **Password-protected case studies** — Friction without clear ROI
13. **Separate `/work` landing page** — Homepage already serves this function
14. **rationale-site `/zero` marketing page** — RationaleStudio version is better

## ZERO MARKETING RECOMMENDATION

**QUESTION:** Should we replace RationaleStudio's `/work/zero` with rationale-site's `/zero` marketing page?

**ANSWER:** ❌ **NO — Keep RationaleStudio version**

**Rationale:**
1. **RationaleStudio version serves dual purpose:**
   - Markets Zero to consumers
   - Proves Rationale's execution capability to B2B buyers

2. **Technical depth is a feature, not a bug:**
   - "10 microservices in production" signals seriousness
   - "7 interactive prototypes" shows systematic validation
   - B2B buyers WANT to see this level of rigor

3. **rationale-site version is consumer-only:**
   - Clean, simple, marketing-forward
   - Lacks depth that B2B buyers need
   - Doesn't connect to "this is how we work for clients"

**OPTIONAL:** Create `/zero` as lightweight consumer-facing landing page (redirect from ads, social, etc.) while keeping `/work/zero` as execution proof.

---

## CONTENT CUTS: WHAT NOT TO BRING

### ❌ Over-Theoretical Content

1. **"The Whiteboard Moment"** origin story
   - Why cut: Abstract, not differentiated ("AI inverted the bottleneck" is consultant-speak)
   - What to keep: Simple statement "We exist to de-risk direction before accelerating execution"

2. **Philosophy-heavy positioning**
   - Why cut: Buyers want proof, not mental model education
   - What to keep: 2-3 core beliefs, concisely stated

3. **Extended founder narrative**
   - Why cut: Pottery, beef wellington, Peloton hobbies are LinkedIn material, not commercial site content
   - What to keep: 7 years Meta, patent, why Rationale exists

### ❌ Redundant Frameworks

4. **"Progressive Conviction" framework**
   - Why cut: Already covered by process timeline in `/how-we-work`
   - Redundant with "Stage 1-4" approach

5. **"Circuit Before Lightbulb" framework**
   - Why cut: Redundant with "Clarity Precedes Illumination" mental model
   - Same concept, different framing

6. **"Environment Shapes Behavior" mental model**
   - Why cut: Generic UX principle, not Rationale-specific differentiator
   - Nice to have, not core to commercial value

7. **"Intelligence Felt, Not Flaunted" mental model**
   - Why cut: Generic AI UX principle, every AI company says this
   - Not differentiated enough to warrant inclusion

### ❌ Friction-Creating Content

8. **Password-protected case studies**
   - Why cut: Creates friction without clear conversion path
   - Alternative: Make fully public OR remove entirely
   - If keeping: Ensure password is easy to get (form fill, immediate access)

9. **Separate `/work` landing page**
   - Why cut: Homepage already serves this function
   - RationaleStudio's structure (Portfolio featured on homepage) is better

3. Add 2 core mental models to `/about`
4. Update navigation

### Week 2: Enhancement
5. Add Portfolio IP metrics to `/about`
6. Condense founder bio and add to `/about`
7. Add 2-3 Meta past experience projects to `/about`
8. Review and tighten all copy for commercial tone

### Week 3: Polish
9. Add 1-2 practical frameworks (optional)
10. Create optional `/frameworks` page for deep content
11. Final review for over-leveraging and gimmicks
12. Ensure all CTAs are clear and prominent

---

## FINAL NOTES

**The rationale-site has excellent content foundation, but it's over-engineered for commercial purposes.**

**Core principle: Lead with proof (Zero), not philosophy. Make engagement tiers immediately legible. Use Meta credentials as context, not primary authority.**

**RationaleStudio's current homepage structure is BETTER than what I infer rationale-site's would be. Keep that. Enhance About, add How We Work, tighten everything else.**

**When in doubt: Cut. Complexity kills conversion.**
