# Content Migration Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-12-02
**Reviewer:** Rationale Marketing Reviewer
**Decision:** Port 30-40% of rationale-site content, ruthlessly cut the rest

---

## TL;DR

rationale-site has **excellent structured content** but suffers from three critical flaws:

1. **Over-leveraging Meta credentials** (borrowed authority instead of current proof)
2. **Over-complexity** (4 mental models + 4 frameworks = cognitive overload)
3. **Philosophy-heavy, proof-light** (theory over execution proof)

**RationaleStudio's current homepage structure is BETTER.** Keep it. Port engagement tiers, enhance About, streamline philosophy to 2-3 beliefs.

---

## WHAT TO PORT (HIGH VALUE)

### ✅ 1. `/how-we-work` Page — **PORT ENTIRELY**
**Why:** Crystal clear engagement models (Cash, Equity, Hybrid), process timeline, equity structures. Already lean and commercial. No cuts needed.

**Commercial Value:** 9/10

**What to bring:**
- Three engagement models with structures
- Process timeline (Week 1-6+)
- "Why equity alignment matters" section
- Zero proof callout ("Like Zero—we take equity when we believe")

---

### ✅ 2. Dual-Engine Model — **PORT WITH EDITS**
**Why:** Well-articulated explanation of how Portfolio IP + Client Kits create virtuous cycle. Missing from current public site.

**Commercial Value:** 8/10

**What to bring:**
- Rationale Kits fund runway
- Portfolio IP accumulates value
- How both engines compound

**Where to add:** `/about` page, new section after "Who We Are"

---

### ✅ 3. Core Beliefs (Mental Models) — **PORT 2-3 MAX**
**Why:** Differentiated positioning, but 4 models = overload. Cut to 2-3.

**Commercial Value:** 7/10

**What to bring:**
- "Clarity Precedes Illumination" (circuit before lightbulb)
- "Course Before Speed" (direction before acceleration)
- "Build to Prove" (working software over pitch decks)

**What to cut:**
- "Environment Shapes Behavior" (generic UX principle)
- "Intelligence Felt, Not Flaunted" (every AI company says this)

**Where to add:** `/about` page, replace current "Philosophy" section

---

### ✅ 4. Portfolio IP Proof — **PORT METRICS**
**Why:** Quantifies execution capability. Currently missing from public site.

**Commercial Value:** 9/10

**What to bring:**
- 3 Active Ventures
- 1 Month Concept to Complete Plan
- 350KB+ Documentation
- 7 Interactive Prototypes (Zero)
- 10 Microservices in Production (Zero)

**Where to add:** `/about` page, new "Portfolio Proof" section

---

### ✅ 5. Founder Background — **PORT WITH CUTS**
**Why:** Credibility without credential-waving. Currently too brief on public site.

**Commercial Value:** 7/10

**What to bring:**
- 7 years Meta Reality Labs (condensed)
- 2-3 key Meta projects (not all 4)
- Patent citation
- Why Rationale exists (2-3 paragraphs)

**What to cut:**
- Extended personal story (6 paragraphs → 3 paragraphs)
- Hobby details (pottery, beef wellington, Peloton) — LinkedIn material

**Where to add:** `/about` page, enhance existing "Founder Background"

---

## WHAT TO SKIP (LOW VALUE)

### ❌ 1. "The Whiteboard Moment" Origin Story
**Why:** Abstract, not differentiated. "AI inverted the bottleneck" is consultant-speak. Doesn't demonstrate lived experience.

**Alternative:** Simple statement "We exist to de-risk direction before accelerating execution"

---

### ❌ 2. Two Additional Mental Models
**Why:** Cognitive overload. 4 models → 2-3 models is already plenty.

**Cut:**
- "Environment Shapes Behavior" (not Rationale-specific)
- "Intelligence Felt, Not Flaunted" (generic AI UX)

---

### ❌ 3. Two Additional Frameworks
**Why:** Redundant with existing content.

**Cut:**
- "Progressive Conviction" (already covered by process timeline)
- "Circuit Before Lightbulb" (redundant with "Clarity Precedes Illumination")

**Optional:** Create `/frameworks` deep-dive page (future enhancement, not launch requirement)

---

### ❌ 4. Password-Protected Case Studies
**Why:** Creates friction without clear conversion path. rationale-site has Fubo, Rumi, Zero as password-protected.

**Alternative:** Either make fully public OR remove entirely. RationaleStudio's approach (Zero fully public as proof) is better.

---

### ❌ 5. Separate `/work` Landing Page
**Why:** RationaleStudio's homepage already serves this function. Portfolio IP featured prominently.

**Alternative:** Move past Meta experience to `/about` page (not separate page)

---

### ❌ 6. rationale-site `/zero` Marketing Page
**Why:** RationaleStudio's `/work/zero` is BETTER. It serves dual purpose: markets Zero AND proves Rationale's execution capability.

**Keep:** RationaleStudio's `/work/zero` (10 microservices, 7 prototypes, investment opportunity)

---

## CRITICAL RISKS IDENTIFIED

### 🚨 Risk 1: Meta Credential Over-Leverage

**Evidence:**
- `/work` page leads with "Past Experience" (Meta AR 2018-2024)
- 4 separate Meta projects detailed
- Founder personal story is 6 paragraphs

**Why this is a risk:**
- Borrowed authority ≠ proof YOU can execute NOW
- Buyers care about "what can you do for me" not "where did you work"

**Correction:**
- Lead with Zero proof (RationaleStudio's current approach is correct)
- Mention Meta in passing ("7 years at Meta taught us...")
- Cut founder story from 6 paragraphs → 3 paragraphs

---

### 🚨 Risk 2: Over-Complexity & Philosophy Overload

**Evidence:**
- 4 mental models + 4 frameworks = 8 concepts to absorb
- Each with setup, analogy, application, when to use, how it works, outcomes
- ~420 lines in `philosophy.ts` alone

**Why this is a risk:**
- Buyers want clarity, not mental model education
- 8 frameworks = cognitive overload = "this feels complicated"
- Philosophy-heavy positioning signals theory over execution

**Correction:**
- Cut to 2-3 core beliefs maximum
- Make frameworks optional/secondary (not primary messaging)
- Lead with proof (Zero), not philosophy

---

### 🚨 Risk 3: Unclear Commercial Pathway

**Evidence:**
- `/about` page is 632 lines of philosophy, founder story, frameworks
- `/how-we-work` exists but may not be prominently linked
- Inferred homepage leads with philosophy (not verified)

**Why this is a risk:**
- Buyers need to self-qualify: "Is this for me? What's the price? How do I start?"
- Philosophy pages don't convert — clear service tiers do

**Correction:**
- Keep RationaleStudio's services structure visible on homepage
- Add `/how-we-work` page with clear engagement tiers
- Make engagement models discoverable within 2 clicks

---

## ZERO CONTENT RECOMMENDATION

**Question:** Should we replace RationaleStudio's `/work/zero` with rationale-site's `/zero` marketing page?

**Answer:** ❌ **NO — Keep RationaleStudio version**

**Why:**

| **RationaleStudio `/work/zero`** | **rationale-site `/zero`** |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Dual-purpose: markets Zero + proves capability | Consumer-only marketing |
| Technical depth (10 microservices, 7 prototypes) | Lightweight features grid |
| "What Zero Proves About Rationale" section | No connection to client work |
| Investment opportunity explicit | No investment mention |
| B2B + B2C audience | B2C only |

**RationaleStudio's version is SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER for commercial goals.**

**Optional:** Create `/zero` as lightweight consumer landing page (for ads/social) while keeping `/work/zero` as execution proof.

---

## RECOMMENDED NEW SITE STRUCTURE

### Current RationaleStudio (✅ KEEP):
```
/ (homepage)
  → Hero: "Don't Build the Wrong Thing for 6 Months"
  → Ex-Meta credentials (brief)
  → Portfolio IP (Zero featured)
  → Dual-engine model
  → Services (3 kits)
  → CTA

/about (basic)
/work/zero (full execution proof)
/work/compass (supporting proof)
/contact
```

### Recommended Enhanced Structure:

```
/ (homepage) — NO CHANGES
  → Keep current structure

/about (ENHANCED)
  → Who We Are (2-3 paragraphs)
  → Dual-Engine Model (NEW)
  → Core Beliefs (NEW, 2-3 models)
  → Portfolio Proof (NEW, metrics)
  → Founder Background (enhanced)
  → CTA

/how-we-work (NEW PAGE)
  → Hero
  → Three Models (Cash, Equity, Hybrid)
  → Process Timeline
  → Why Equity Matters
  → CTA

/work/zero (KEEP AS-IS)
/work/compass (KEEP AS-IS)
/contact (KEEP AS-IS)

OPTIONAL (Future):
/frameworks (deep dive, not required for launch)
```

## SUCCESS METRICS

Content migration is successful when:

**Buyer Comprehension:**
- ✓ Buyer can explain Rationale in one sentence
- ✓ Two growth engines are instantly legible
- ✓ Founders can self-qualify for engagement tier
- ✓ Pricing structure is clear (if not exact numbers)

**Commercial Clarity:**
- ✓ Equity model is explicit (0.5-3%, 6-18 months)
- ✓ Three engagement models discoverable within 2 clicks
- ✓ Zero is hero, Meta is supporting context
- ✓ Portfolio IP metrics are visible

**Tone & Positioning:**
- ✓ No gimmicky language or over-leveraged authority
- ✓ Philosophy is practical, not theoretical
- ✓ Copy is commercial, not consultant-speak
- ✓ Mental models reduced to 2-3 (not 4+)

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Lead with proof (Zero), not philosophy**
2. **RationaleStudio's current homepage is BETTER — keep it**
3. **When in doubt: Cut. Complexity kills conversion.**
4. **Meta credentials = context, not primary authority**
5. **Equity model = feature, not footnote**
6. **Zero = hero, Compass = supporting, Meta = background**
