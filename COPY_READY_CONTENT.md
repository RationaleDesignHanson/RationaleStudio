# How We Work

**Engagement models built for speed and alignment**

From 2-week validation sprints to multi-year equity partnerships. We structure every engagement around what you need—and what we believe is worth building together.
```

---

### Three Engagement Models Section

```markdown
## Three Ways to Work Together

Every engagement can be structured as cash, equity, or hybrid based on timeline, scope, and mutual belief.
```

#### Model 1: Cash Engagements

```markdown
### Cash Engagements

**When you need speed and certainty**

Fixed-scope sprints and validation engagements. You pay, we deliver, no equity complexity. Best for teams with runway who need fast answers or prototypes to de-risk direction.

**Best For:**
- 2-6 week validation sprints
- Pre-seed founders testing ideas
- Series A+ de-risking features
- Clear scope, fast timeline

**Structure:**
- Fixed deliverables
- Clear timeline (2-12 weeks)
- Payment upfront or milestones
- IP transfers at completion
```

#### Model 2: Equity Partnerships (Featured)

```markdown
### Equity Partnerships

**When we believe in what you're building**

We become your product co-founder. Equity-only or reduced cash + equity. Highly selective (2-3 active at a time). We only partner when our expertise creates strategic advantage in AI, AR, or 0-1 products.

**Like Zero:** We're building our own AI email platform from concept to market. 1 month to complete execution plan, 7 working prototypes. Same conviction we bring to equity partnerships. [See our proof →](/work/zero)

**Best For:**
- 6-18 month build partnerships
- Fractional CPO relationships
- Pre-seed to Series A
- AI/AR/0-1 product expertise

**Structure:**
- 0.5-3% equity typical
- Vesting over engagement period
- Board observer rights (optional)
- Long-term aligned incentives
```

#### Model 3: Hybrid (Cash + Equity)

```markdown
### Hybrid (Cash + Equity)

**Most common for longer engagements**

Reduced cash rate + equity stake. You conserve runway, we share upside. Typical for 3-12 month builds where mutual belief is high but you need to preserve capital for engineering and growth.

**Best For:**
- 3-12 month product builds
- Seed-stage runway preservation
- Strategic partnership mindset
- Ongoing post-launch support

**Structure:**
- 50-70% cash discount
- 0.5-2% equity typical
- Milestone-based payments
- Shared success metrics
```

---

### Our Process Section

```markdown
## Our Process

Every engagement starts the same way: understanding your riskiest assumptions.

**Week 1: Align**
We map your product thesis, biggest unknowns, and success criteria. What would prove this is worth building? What would kill it?

**Weeks 2-4: Prototype**
We build functional software that tests your core assumptions. Not mockups—working demos you can put in front of users or investors.

**Weeks 4-6: Test & Validate**
We run your prototype through real usage scenarios. User testing, technical validation, market signal gathering. Evidence, not opinions.

**Week 6+: Refine or Build**
Based on what we learned: pivot, persevere, or scale. If it's working, we help you build it. If not, we help you redirect before burning runway.
```

---

### Why Equity Alignment Matters Section

```markdown
## Why Equity Alignment Matters

Equity is not just about economics—it changes how we think, decide, and build together.

**What Changes:**
- We say no to bad ideas (even if billable)
- We prioritize long-term value over scope
- We are incentivized to build IP, not deliverables
- We care about your Series A, not just handoff

**What Doesn't Change:**
- We still move fast (equity ≠ slow)
- You still own your company and roadmap
- We are selective, not transactional
- Clear deliverables and milestones still exist
```

---

### CTA Section

```markdown
## Figure Out the Right Structure Together

Every engagement starts with a conversation about your timeline, runway, and what you're trying to prove.

## SECTION 2: `/about` PAGE ENHANCED COPY

### Who We Are Section

```markdown
## Who We Are

Rationale is a product development studio founded by Matt Hanson, former Meta Reality Labs Senior Product Design Manager (7 years). We build products that ship—not prototypes that sit in Figma.

After a decade building at scale for Meta and publicly traded companies, we're now applying that same systematic execution to our own Portfolio IP and select client partnerships. We operate on a dual-engine model: Portfolio IP (products we own) proves our capability, and Client Kits (structured engagements) fund our runway.

Our work is governed by a simple belief: **clarity precedes execution, course precedes speed, and conviction is the scarcest resource.**
```

---

### Dual-Engine Model Section (NEW)

```markdown
## Two Engines, One System

Rationale grows through two tightly integrated engines that create a virtuous cycle of proof and revenue.

### Portfolio IP — Products We Own

Design, build, and launch proprietary products like Zero and Compass. These prove our systematic execution and generate IP we can scale or license.

*Zero proof: 1 month concept to App Store. Compass: 6-week prototype sprint. Both demonstrate velocity across domains.*

### Client Kits — Partnerships We Build

Transform client product challenges into shipped software via structured engagements: Clarity Kits (2 weeks), Prototype Kits (4-6 weeks), Build Ship Run (6-18 months).

*Cash, equity, or hybrid structures. Same systematic velocity.*

### Why Both?

Portfolio IP proves capability and funds runway. Client Kits fund Portfolio development and harden our frameworks. Both engines compound: every pilot hardens our systems, every product validates our approach.

This isn't a studio that does client work on the side. This is a studio that builds IP through both channels—yours and ours.

### Core Beliefs Section (NEW — replaces "Philosophy")

```markdown
## Core Beliefs

Our work is guided by mental models forged through years of shipping 0-1 products at scale.

### Clarity Precedes Illumination

Design the circuit before the lightbulb. The most elegant execution is meaningless without an underlying system of clarity, behavior, and intent. We map the problem space before the solution space, define behavior change (not features), and build conviction before execution.

### Course Before Speed

Direction is the new bottleneck. AI has given everyone unprecedented speed, but without clear direction, more speed only gets you lost faster. We validate assumptions before scaling, test the hardest risks first, and build the map before accelerating.

### Build to Prove

Working software > pitch decks. We don't just plan products—we build functional prototypes to validate assumptions. Zero went from concept to App Store in 1 month with 7 interactive prototypes validating core mechanics before launch.
```

---

### Portfolio Proof Section (NEW)

```markdown
## Portfolio IP — Proof of Systematic Execution

These mental models aren't theoretical—we apply them to our own Portfolio IP. Conviction-backed ventures that prove our systematic execution.

**Metrics:**
- **3** Active Ventures
- **1 Month** Concept to Complete Plan
- **350KB+** Documentation
- **7** Interactive Prototypes (Zero)
- **10** Microservices in Production (Zero)

### Zero · AI Email Triage

Full transparency: Live on App Store, 4-cohort beta rollout, complete fundraising deck. This is how we prove speed.

[View complete details →](/work/zero)

### Compass · AI Video Intelligence

AI video indexing with cultural and emotional intelligence. Proof of range: AI across different domains.

[View details →](/work/compass)

### Building in Public

We ship 1-2 products per quarter. Zero took 6 weeks from concept to complete execution plan. Follow our progress as we build the next one.

### Founder Background Section (ENHANCED)

```markdown
## Founder Background

**Matt Hanson**
*Founder, Rationale Studio*

Matt founded Rationale in response to a critical problem: AI has made execution cheap and fast, but teams are building the wrong things faster than ever. His mission is to protect founders from the biggest risk in product development—speed without direction.

### Beyond Work Section (Keep as-is from RationaleStudio)

```markdown
## Beyond Work

Father of three daughters. When not building products, you'll find me throwing pottery, experimenting in the kitchen (beef wellington is a specialty), or logging miles on the Peloton.

These pursuits aren't separate from the work—they're all about the same thing: systematic practice, iterative improvement, and finding joy in the process of making things better.
```

---

### CTA Section (ENHANCED)

```markdown

Ready to build with conviction? Whether you need a 2-week validation sprint or a multi-year equity partnership, we're here to help you de-risk direction before accelerating execution.
